 * A bare filename is close to useless for a purchase receipt: the whole point of
 * keeping one is to check a price or a warranty, and you cannot check anything
 * from a filename. So this offers the three things that make the file usable -
 * look at it, download it, remove it - and shows what kind of file it is without
 * opening anything.
 *
 * EVERY BYTE IS FETCHED THROUGH AXIOS. The endpoint is authenticated, so an <img>
 * or <a> pointed straight at it renders a 401 as the image. That is also why the
 * object URL is revoked on unmount; see useAttachmentUrl.
