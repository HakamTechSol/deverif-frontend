/**
 * Guards the two UI problems from the last round, both of which type checking
 * and the i18n audit were blind to.
 *
 * 1. THE DETAIL PANEL. It was built on `Drawer`, which is vaul - a MOBILE BOTTOM
 *    SHEET. It ignores `w-full max-w-*`, slides up from the bottom edge, and on a
 *    narrow viewport the panel was clipped off-screen with no reachable close
 *    control. `Sheet` is the Radix side-panel primitive and is the correct
 *    choice for a desktop slide-over.
 *
 * 2. THE DIALOG INTERPOLATION. i18next reads {{name}}. A single-brace {name} is
 *    ICU syntax it parses and leaves alone, so the template rendered literally as
 *    Delete "{name}"?. The key existed in both locale files and parity was 100%,
 *    so nothing caught it.
 *
 * Both are asserted textually because neither is visible to any other kind of
 * check: the panel's geometry and a string that is correct until rendered.
