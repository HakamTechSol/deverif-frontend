/**
 * Frontend-side guarantees for the assets module.
 *
 * These are the mistakes type checking cannot catch, because each one is a
 * perfectly valid value in its own right:
 *
 *  1. SENDING `status` FROM THE CLIENT. The server derives status and ignores
 *     anything posted, so a status field on a payload is a control the user can
 *     move that silently does nothing - the worst kind of bug, because it looks
 *     like it worked.
 *
 *  2. AN ACTION THE SERVER WILL REFUSE. A menu offering "Assign" on a retired
 *     asset teaches people the page is broken.
 *
 *  3. FILE HANDLING. Receipts and invoices are attachment entities uploaded as
 *     multipart. A JSON POST of a File object would upload the string
 *     "[object File]" and still report success.
