/**
 * Guarantees for the offboarding pages that type checking and the i18n audit are
 * both blind to. Each is a value that is perfectly valid in isolation and wrong in
 * combination with something else.
 *
 *  1. A CLEARANCE BUTTON THAT FAILS ON CLICK. The server refuses clearance against
 *     an unapproved exit and refuses to process a settlement while an asset is
 *     held. Offering the action anyway teaches people the page is unreliable, so
 *     both are disabled with the reason attached - the same rule the assets page
 *     follows for Retire.
 *
 *  2. THE ASSET CAP MADE INVISIBLE. When a laptop costs more than the settlement,
 *     only the settlement can cover is deducted and the remainder is recorded as
 *     still owed. Showing only the applied figure presents a capped deduction as a
 *     cleared debt, which is the opposite of what it is.
 *
 *  3. THE FnF FIGURES AS A SINGLE NET NUMBER. A settlement is a document somebody
 *     has to justify to the person receiving it, so the inputs travel with the
 *     result.
 *
 *  4. THE EMPLOYEE PAGE HIDING ITS OWN FORM. A submitted request is not editable:
 *     the notice period is agreed with HR, so letting someone keep editing a date
 *     only creates a mismatch between what they think they agreed and the record.
